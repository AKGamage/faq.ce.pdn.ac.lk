question="How can I connect to this server?"
answer="You can use SSH login. Since turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk is not a public IP you shoud either (a) use a computer in the
Peradeniya network or (b) SSH to a public IP server like tesla.ce.pdn.ac.lk or aiken.ce.pdn.ac.lk and SSH to
turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk from there."

question="What datasets are hosted in Turing?"
answer="
We store frequently used datasets inside the turing.ce.pdn.ac.lk local storage for easy access. You can access
these by the following commands

`ls /storage/datasets/`

These datasets are in the read only mode. You can use these datsets as the input for your tasks but you have to
output the results to your home directory. The following datasets are stored at the moment.

- THIS LIST WILL BE POPULATED SOON

If you have suggestions for what datasets should be made available on this server, please send a request via
email available in [https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gihan/contact/](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gihan/contact/) address." %}
