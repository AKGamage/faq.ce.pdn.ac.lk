question="How can I connect to this server?"
answer="You can use ssh login. Since kepler.ce.pdn.ac.lk is not a public IP you should either
- use a computer in the Peradeniya network or
- ssh to a public IP server like tesla.ce.pdn.ac.lk or aiken.ce.pdn.ac.lk and ssh to kepler.ce.pdn.ac.lk from there."

question="What datasets are hosted in kepler?"
answer="
We store frequently used datasets inside the kepler.ce.pdn.ac.lk local storage for easy access. You can access these by
the following command:

`ls /storage/datasets/`

These datasets are in the read only mode. You can use these datsets as the input for your tasks but you have to output
the results to your home directory. The following datasets are stored at the moment.

* [CIFAR (10 and 100)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
* MOT 15,16,17,20: [https://motchallenge.net/](https://motchallenge.net/). Please note that there is an issue with
unzipping MOT17.
* Shapenet (core) v1: [https://www.shapenet.org/](https://www.shapenet.org/), [Research
Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03012).
