    <question>
        What is the difference between a core course and an elective?
    </question>

    <answer>
        <p>Core courses and elective courses are different types of courses that are typically offered in undergraduate programs.
<br><br>
Core courses are required courses that all students in a particular program must take. These courses are intended to provide students with a strong foundation in the subject matter and to develop essential skills. They are typically focused on the main concepts and theories of the program and are usually mandatory to graduate.
<br><br>
Elective courses, on the other hand, are courses that students can choose to take but are not required. These courses are intended to allow students to explore specific areas of interest or to gain additional knowledge in specialized areas. Elective courses are often offered as a way for students to diversify their knowledge and skills, to tailor their education to their personal or career goals, or to fulfill certain degree requirements.

 </li>
            <li>Curriculum updates: Check if the elective course is being updated or replaced with new ones, taking the updated version may be beneficial.
 </li>
            <li>Hands-on experience: Look for electives that offer hands-on experience with real-world projects or industry partnerships. This can give you valuable skills and insights that will be useful in your future career.
 </li>
            <li>Research opportunities: See if the elective offers any research opportunities. This can give you a chance to work with a professor on a research project, which can be a great way to gain experience and potentially lead to publications or other opportunities.
 </li>
